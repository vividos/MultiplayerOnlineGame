# MultiplayerOnlineGame #

My attempt at creating a multiplayer game.

## Projects ##

This code repository contains several projects in various states of completion.

### Common projects ###

Some Visual Studio projects exist that are used by several projects. They are not specific to
any project. See projects Base, RenderEngine, UserInterface, ClientLogic, etc.

### MultiplayerOnlineGame ###

A collection of classes to implement client and server parts of a multiplayer game.

### Underworld ###

This is a remake of Ultima Underworld[TM] that is ported from the [http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/](http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/ "Underworld Adventures") project to check if the common projects are of any use.
