/*! \page testing The Library Validation Program

The library includes a validation suite. It is primarily for use in Boost's own
testing, but you can build and run it if desired to confirm that it the library
is working properly. You can find the source code for it in the \c
libs/xint/test directory. All of the major functions are thoroughly exercised,
and many of the minor ones as well.

The source code for the testing suite also demonstrates how to use many of the
library's functions.
