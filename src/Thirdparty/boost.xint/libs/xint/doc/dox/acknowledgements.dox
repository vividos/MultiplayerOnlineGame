Several people have helped me improve the XInt library. Particular thanks go to
Paul Bristow, for...
- Pointing out the need for a specialization of \c std::numeric_limits for the
library-provided types;
- Spending a great deal of time and effort to introduce me to the Boost.Test
framework and Doxygen/QuickBook;
- Providing test cases and documentation tweaks;
- General advice and moral support.

...and to Jeffrey Lee Hellrung, Jr., for...
- advice on implementing move-aware objects;
- an invigorating discussion on the differing needs of an integer library versus
a floating-point one;
- politely pointing out a logic bug that I was blind to;
- and several other things that I'm sure I missed.

The library wouldn't be nearly as good without their work.

Other contributors from the Boost development list, roughly in the order that
they contributed:

- Steven Watanabe, for an improvement to the template constructor, and for
comments on the random number code.
- Scott McMurray, for comments on the random number code, the Not-a-Number
value, and the blockable exceptions design, and for accidentally pointing out an
error in the square-root function, among other things.
- "Pavel" for suggesting adding the algorithmic complexity of each function to
the documentation, and for more than once understanding what I was trying to
explain when no one else seemed to.
- Vincente Juan Botet Escrib√°, for doubting everything I wrote... irritating,
but sometimes useful.
- Peter Dimov, for suggesting a separate \c overflow_error exception class.
- "Fred," a.k.a. "Gottlob Frege", for information on infinities.
- Joachim Faulhaber, for a discussion of intervals and interval containers.
- Domagoj Saric, for suggesting a design that would allow for both
variable-length and fixed-length integers.
- Juergen Hunold, for major improvements to the build system.
- Robert Stewart, for a thorough review of the headers.
- John Bytheway, for an idea for simplifying the template documentation greatly.
- David Abrahams, for contributing a thought on how to use Boost.Parameter
effectively with multiple \c bool parameters.
- Christopher Jefferson, for sharing the best way to support \c
BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS.
- Adam Merz, for his advice on proper wstring/wchar_t support.

And the other Boost development list members who joined the discussion:
