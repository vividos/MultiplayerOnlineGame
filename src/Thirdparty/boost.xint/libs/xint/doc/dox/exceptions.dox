/*! \page exceptions Exceptions and the \c nothrow_integer Type

Many things can go wrong while operating on an integer, such as divide-by-zero
errors. Under normal circumstances, these result in exceptions, but exceptions
sometimes make your code harder to follow, or even harder to write. That's why
this library includes the \c nothrow_integer type.

The \c xint::nothrow_integer type has all of the functions that the \c
xint::integer type does (they're generated from the same class template). When
you use it, any exceptions generated by the library are caught internally, and
the functions return a special value indicating failure (the \ref
nan "Not-a-Number" value on functions returning an integer_t type, otherwise the
value will be noted in the documentation).

Here's an example, which can be found in the \c examples subdirectory as
exceptions.cpp:

\include exceptions.cpp
