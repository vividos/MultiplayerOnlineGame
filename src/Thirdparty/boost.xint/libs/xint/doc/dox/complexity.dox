/*! \page complexity A Note on Algorithmic Complexity

This documentation includes a time-complexity estimate, in big-O notation, for
each algorithm. The \c n in the complexity estimates is roughly the number of
bits in the parameter(s). (More accurately, it's the number of \c digit_t values
needed to hold those bits.) For those algorithms where the complexity
calculation differs for different parameters, the parameter is noted as a
subscript.

The time complexity is well-known for some algorithms, but for others, I had to
make an educated guess. If you discover an error in the listed complexity,
please report it.
