/*! \page r_exception_blocking Why have a nothrow_integer type at all?

Exceptions are standard C++, but there are a number of people that dislike them
intensely and won't use any library that forces its users to deal with them.
That is not the primary motivation for the \c nothrow_integer type though.

There are also times when exception-handling can get in the way of writing code
that is easily understandable by other people. Any software developer
understands calling a function and checking the return value to see if there was
an error; it's a standard idiom in essentially any programming language, and
it's even widely used in the C++ Standard Template Library (see \c
std::string::find, for just one example).

Writing code that is \e human-readable -- not just machine-readable -- is
difficult, and there's little that anyone can do to change that. But giving the
developer the choice to use either exceptions or error codes, depending on which
is most readable, makes it easier to produce such code, and costs nothing to the
people who choose not to use it.
