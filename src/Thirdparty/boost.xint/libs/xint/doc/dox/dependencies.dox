/*! \page dependencies Dependencies

Like any non-trivial program, this library uses several other pieces of code,
though I've tried to minimize the dependencies. Here are the ones that are
required:

- Boost.Integer
- Boost.Function
- Boost.StaticAssert
- Boost.Random
- Boost.TypeTraits
- Boost.SmartPtr
- Boost.Parameter
- Boost.Move

All of these are header-only libraries, meaning that you don't need to worry
about linking your program with them.
