Installation instructions

* Copy (or link) the contents of the boost directory directly under the
  $(BOOST_ROOT)/boost directory.
* Copy (or link) the contents of the libs directory directly under
  $(BOOST_ROOT)/libs.

That's it!

Notes:

The code has been fully tested under Windows (MSVC 8 SP1) and Linux (GCC 4.4.3).

See the very thorough documentation for any other questions, or ask me (Chad
Nelson) on the Boost developer's mailing list. Please put [xint] at the
beginning of the subject line so I'll notice it faster.
